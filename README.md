# Generic-ArrayToUL
Convert any array into an html unordered list, keeping the same structure.

This package uses jQuery and allows you to output the list both in a form a full html page or just the ul element itself.

The javascript is for a toggle button that is added to the main root if flag supplied with true.

The whole point of this package is to allow converting any array to a pretty output which can also be maniuplated easliy.
